## Classilla has moved to [Github](https://github.com/classilla/classilla)! From the bottom of our hearts, Google: you suck. ##

A fork of Mozilla for classic Macintosh systems, with upgrades for security, stability and functionality. Targeted for Mac OS 9 with support for OS 8.6 where possible, and compatible with 10.1.5-10.3.9 under Classic. If you're looking for a browser for PPC 10.4+, see our sister project, [TenFourFox](http://www.tenfourfox.com/).

**This project site is no longer updated because Google are meaniepants.** Historical wiki documentation and downloads from 9.0-9.3.2 remain here while they last. Do not use them for current versions of Classilla. Current downloads for Classilla 9.3.3+ (including the source code) are available from [SourceForge](http://classilla.sourceforge.net/).
